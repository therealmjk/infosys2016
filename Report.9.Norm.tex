\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item The customer table was created because this table saves all the information of all the customers on a seperate table since it's possible to have over a thousands of customers.
\\
\item A product table also created to store all the products on a separate table since we could also have so many products.
\\
\item The order table stores the orders made by the customer. This has a relationship to the customer table to show which customer placed an order.
\\
\item The fourth table is the OrderProducts table that saves the products that were ordered. This has a relationship to the order table to show the products that an order has.
