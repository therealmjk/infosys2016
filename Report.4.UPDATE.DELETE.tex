1. Steps & Explanation
	i. Insert a new record into the department table with dept_no='d010' and dept_name='Research and 								   Development'
	   We need this new row in the database to have a department called 'Reserch and Development' so as to 	be able to
	   update employees in the Development and Research department to our newly created department.
	   
    ii.Insert a new record into the department table with dept_no='d011' and dept_name='Marketing and Sales'
	   We need this new row in the database to have a department called 'Marketing and Sales' so as to be able to
	   update employees in the Marketing and Sales department to our newly created department.
	   
	iii. We need to identify the tables that uses the dept_no and update the dept_no. The tables in this case are dept_emp 				 and dept_manager. We need to update the dept_no 'd005' and 'd008' to 'd010' like wise we need to update dept_no 				 'd001' and 'd007' to 'd011'. These operation should be performed on the dept_emp and dept_manager tables.
	
	iv. When updating we need to use the 'IGNORE' keyword after the update. The reason to use this keyword is because if 				there is a conflict with the primary key you won't be able to replace the department. Using this keyword helps 					delete the record and replaces it with the new record.
